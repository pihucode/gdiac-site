    Astrobeat is a fast-paced rhythm game meant to give you that feeling of satisfaction 
    when every action is perfectly in sync. As the character Aria, you navigate through 
    the universe by traveling from orbit to orbit. Every movement is to the beat of each 
    galaxies' unique music style, and Aria's passion is to explore them all! Along the 
    way, you also have the responsibility to jump start dying planets by completing their 
    rhythm, all while avoiding dangerous asteroids and lasers.

  summary: >
    Use careful planning and quick thinking to breathe life back into an ancient 
    civilization of lonely golems.
  description: |
    In a futuristic world now overrun by forests and left as ruins, low energy golems 
    stumble about aimlessly. Players control a phoenix spirit that revitalizes and 
    charges each golem upon possession. The goal of the game is to possess each golem 
    at least once in each level in order to bring them back to life without overcharging 
    them. Players must navigate the level by strategically positioning golems and 
    executing difficult shots to reach other golems.
