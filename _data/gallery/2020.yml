    In a galaxy full of hungry customers, the player flies through space as a "saucer,” 
    orbiting and launching from planets to cook, season, and serve scrumptious dishes to 
    eager patrons. The galaxy is the kitchen, the sun is the stove, and ingredients orbit 
    various planets. The player needs to collect the relevant ingredients and execute each 
    dish with proper timing to get that high score!

    Focus on creative combination casting and tactical positioning in this turn-based
    strategy game.
  description: |
    Runecasters is a fast-paced turn based strategy game with an emphasis on quick thinking, 
    opponent action prediction, and creative resource utility. Players take turns moving 
    around the board and casting damaging spells at one another in a deul until only one 
    remains! Players can combine their runes to create more powerful versions of the spells 
    they cast, in exchange for a modicum of maneuverability.

    This game does not support networking.  This is a pass-and play game where the players
    take turns by passing the mobile device to each other.
