As the semester ends, it is time once again for the GDIAC showcase. The showcase will include student game projects from the past year. We have a large number of exhibtions, including projects from CS/INFO 3152, CS/INFO 4152 and independent studies.

Last year was an incredible year for mobile and smartphone games. Manic Moving Mansion Mania won Best Student Game at Boston FIG. Underhand went viral on Reddit and has over 600,000 downloads on Android. But despite all that, this year looks even stronger. We have rhythm games, puzzle games, action games, deep strategy games, and even experimental augmented reality games. There is something for everyone.

The showcase is open to the general public, so that everyone can play and experience these projects. In addition, the public is welcome to vote for the favorite in the award ceremony at the end. Come see what all of the excitement is about, and catch the next big game before it breaks out.

Date/Time: Friday, May 18th from 4 - 7 pm
Venue: ACCEL Labs in Carpenter Hall
