As the semester ends, it is time once again for the GDIAC showcase. The showcase will include student game projects from the past year. We have a large number of exhibtions, including projects from CS/INFO 3152, CS/INFO 4152 and independent studies.

Last year was the 10th year that Walker White has directed the GDIAC program, and it was a great year. Once again, we placed several of our games at Boston FIG. The viral success of Underhand has continued, and it now has over a million downloads on Android. As Professor White enters his second decade running the program, we once again have a strong slate of games.

The showcase is open to the general public, so that everyone can play and experience these projects. In addition, the public is welcome to vote for the favorite in the award ceremony at the end. Come see what all of the excitement is about, and catch the next big game before it breaks out.

Date/Time: Friday, May 17th from 4 - 7 pm
Venue: ACCEL Labs in Carpenter Hall
