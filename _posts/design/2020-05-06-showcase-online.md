Despite the chaos of a somewhat online semester, our games have been going strong. In the past year 2019 favorite Family Style has been featured on the Apple App store and now has over 1.5 million downloads on all platforms. It even has its own Reddit channel.

After much discussion, we have decided that COVID-19 will not stand in the way of showcase. On Friday, May 22nd, we will make all of the games for this semester available for download from the official Showcase page. But more importantly, we will also issue temporary invites for everyone to join our Discord server. This is open to the general public -- you do not need to be affiliated with Cornell. You can watch other people stream their games, stream yourself playing, or just get technical support if you are having trouble installing.

There are a lot of high quality games this year and we want them to have the same experience that Family Style did last year -- getting the feedback that they need to push their games to the next level. So come join us on May 22nd!

**Date/Time**: Friday, May 22nd from 1 -4 pm

**Venue**: Discord (Invite link on Showcase page)
