The Game Design Initiative at Cornell (GDIAC) is an interdisciplinary program that is hosted within the [Department of Computer Science][1]. It offers a minor in game design accessible to Cornell students regardless of college or major. Even though it only offers a minor, the program is a highly-regarded program for technical areas such as software development, technical game design, game analytics, and project management.

The Game Design Initiative was formed in 2001. It was one of the first official computer game programs of its kind, and the first such program established in an Ivy League school. While computer game programs are becoming more and more common at other Universities, Cornell's program remains strong. The Game Design Initiative allows students to earn a world-class Cornell education while having fun working in computer games.

[Cornell University][2] is located in Ithaca, New York, a city of about 30,000 people in the heart of the Finger Lakes region. Both Cornell and Ithaca offer a wide range of cultural activities, sports, and outdoor activities with the pleasures of both city and country close at hand.

Information on [Visiting Cornell][3] is available from the main Cornell website.

## History & Mission

\\
In the Fall 2001, The Game Design Initiative at Cornell (GDIAC) was formed by a group of students, faculty, and alumni who wished to study game design in an academic setting. At first an informal organization, GDIAC gained official recognition with the creation of the Minor in Game Design in Fall 2006.

Currently, GDIAC supports undergraduate courses in game design and development, game-oriented graduate student projects, a youth-outreach program, and game-related faculty research. Through its efforts, GDIAC strives to:

- Develop game design and development as an academic discipline.

- Prepare students for careers in the entertainment software industry.

- Facilitate interdisciplinary learning.

- Research the social and technical aspects of games.

- Motivate diverse groups to pursue technical studies.

- Perform and disseminate research on game design in multidisciplinary education.

GDIAC currently pursues its missions by creating opportunities for students to develop projects in courses and credit-bearing independent studies. Students with skill and interest in music, art, writing, programming, and/or engineering work in multidisciplinary teams on the interdisciplinary field of game design. Many students continue their game projects over several semesters, thereby developing a large portfolio of technical work. Other students also pursue GDIAC courses as opportunities to develop teamwork and communication skills.
