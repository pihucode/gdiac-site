We are still working on the new website for Showcase. When it is available, this page will link to it, as well as to the list of games that will be downloadable at Showcase.

Games designed for 3152 will be available for both Windows 10 and MacOS (perferably Mojave or higher). Game designed for 4152 will be available for either Android or iOS. Android games will have an APK to directly download, while iOS games will be directed to [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/) or the Apple Store.
