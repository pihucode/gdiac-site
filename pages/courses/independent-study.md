Many GDIAC students work on game design research and game development over a series of semesters, resulting in an extensive portfolio of work in game design. Independent studies are open to any student that has completed [CS/INFO 3152](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3152); completion of CS/INFO 4152 is not required.

To participate in an independent study, the student must find a sponsoring faculty member. The student should submit a project proposal (of the form introduced in CS/INFO 3152) to the faculty member before signing up for the independent study.

Students are expected to form their own teams when working on an independent study. Students that need help recruiting team members for an independent study should work with the Development in Games Association (student organization) to find other interested students.
