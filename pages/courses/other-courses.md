## Computer Science

As the primary sponsor of GDIAC, the Cornell computer science department offers a wide variety of courses for students interested in software development for computer games. The Cornell [program in computer graphics](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/) is highly regarded by academia and industry alike. In addition, several faculty members pursue research in online gaming. The following is a list of the higher level courses offered by the department that are most relevant to game development.

## Information Science

Information science is another important department for our program. Many of the most talented designers in the program chose information science as their primary major. The [Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) group](https://infosci.cornell.edu/research/human-computer-interaction) at Cornell is highly regarded. Even the "pure CS" students in the game design program typically take the HCI courses in the information science department. The principles taught in these courses have a wide variety of applications, beyond gaming.
