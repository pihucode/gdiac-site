    - "The GDIAC gallery contains a limited selection of the games developed here at Cornell. It mainly contains games developed in CS/INFO 3152 (formerly CIS 3000), as well as a few advanced projects. Most of the games are 2D, as the focus of the introductory course is on design and software engineering over advanced graphics. Students in CS 5625 do develop 3D games, but they are not designed for easy distribution."
    - "Students at Cornell retain ownership of their intellectual property, and so GDIAC does not have rights to all student games. We only distribute games that have not been made available commercially. Because of platform restrictions, this means that we do not distribute student iOS games unless the students have made the game available on the App Store (in which case we link directly to the store page)."
    - "All of the games are provided as-is, without any technical support."
