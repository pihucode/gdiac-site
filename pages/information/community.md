## What does GDIAC do outside of Cornell?

GDIAC has forged strong ties in the Ithaca community, and has partnered with organizations such as The Learning Web and The Fingerlakes Unschoolers Network to provide area youth with the opportunity to apprentice with Cornell game developers. The youth get the opportunity both to contribute and learn valuable skills from the mentors on the teams while having a blast making a game.

## How can my child work with a Cornell mentor?

Each semester, we provide local 7-12 graders with an opportunity to work with a Cornell student through the [GDIAC after school program]({{ site.url }}/programs/outreach/). This program runs every semester. The program meets once a week for a total of 10 weeks. If you are interested in getting your child involved in the GDIAC afterschool program, please contact the [GDIAC director]({{ site.url }}/contact/).
