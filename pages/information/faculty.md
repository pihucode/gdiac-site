## Collaborating with GDIAC

The Game Design Initiative at Cornell (GDIAC) allows interested students at Cornell to be involved with game design through course work and hands on experience. The "; ?>GDIAC mission involves fostering collaborations with Cornell students, faculty, and staff. We encourage cross-dsciplinary collaboration through various high-level ideas and areas:

- Joint research projects (e.g., educational methods, theoretical explorations, and outreach).
- Game design and development for education and training.
- Student projects (e.g., studies on gamer culture, teamwork, game content).

Interested faculty should contact the [GDIAC director]({{ site.url }}/contact/) for more information.
