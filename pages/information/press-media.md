## What does GDIAC do?

GDIAC offers three courses on game design and development, which typically involve a little over 100 students a year. Students work in multidisciplinary teams composed of artists, writers, musicians, programmers, and producers, all engages in the processes of design and development of original games.

Through the flexibility of Cornell's independent study courses, students build game portfolios to help them find jobs in the entertainment industry, as well as other related fields. These projects often include cutting-edge game technology, innovations, and industry applications.

GDIAC has helped students in finding internships and full-time jobs in the game industry. It holds ties with industry leaders such as Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Irrational Games, Valve, Riot Games, Pokemon, Zynga, and Bethesda Softworks. GDIAC has also helped to connect students with game development opportunities in the area of education and the military.

GDIAC has also forged strong ties in the Ithaca community, and has partnered with organizations such as The Learning Web and The Fingerlakes Unschoolers Network to provide area youth with the opportunity to apprentice with Cornell game developers. The youth get the opportunity both to contribute and learn valuable skills from the mentors on the teams while having a blast making a game.
