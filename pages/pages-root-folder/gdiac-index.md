  paragraphs:
    - "The GDIAC gallery contains a limited selection of the games developed here at Cornell. It mainly contains games developed in CS/INFO 3152 (formerly CIS 3000), as well as a few advanced projects. Most of the games are 2D, as the focus of the introductory course is on design and software engineering over advanced graphics. Students in CS 5625 do develop 3D games, but they are not designed for easy distribution."

    - "The Game Design Initiative was formed in 2001. It was one of the first official computer game programs of its kind, and the first such program established in an Ivy League school. While computer game programs are becoming more and more common at other Universities, Cornell's program remains strong. The Game Design Initiative allows students to earn a world-class Cornell education while having fun working in computer games."
    
    - "Cornell University is located in Ithaca, New York, a city of about 30,000 people in the heart of the Finger Lakes region. Both Cornell and Ithaca offer a wide range of cultural activities, sports, and outdoor activities with the pleasures of both city and country close at hand."
    
    - "Information on Visiting Cornell is available from the main Cornell website."

    - "Because of COVID, last year saw the annual Cornell games showcase go virtual. Instead of holding a showcase in person, we ran it on our course Discord server. Because Discord allows multiple people to stream games simultaneously, it allowed us to capture the festive atmosphere of Showcase in a remote setting. With over 700 people joining us on our server, it was a smashing success."

    - "And now another year has passed, so it is time to do this again. On Tuesday, May 25th, we will make all of the games for this semester available for download from the official Showcase page. More importantly, we will also issue temporary invites for everyone to join our Discord server. This is open to the general public -- you do not need to be affiliated with Cornell. You can watch other people stream their games, stream yourself playing, or just get technical support if you are having trouble installing."

    - "There are a lot of high quality games this year, and we are going to be doing some experiments to make the mobile games more streaming friendly. Come and join us on May 2th and see what all the excitement is about!"
