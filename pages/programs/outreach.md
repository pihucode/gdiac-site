In response to the demand by local youth who are extremely interested in games and game design, GDIAC has developed an afterschool program for Tompkins county students in grades 7-12. In this program, students are introduced to the basics of game development through game authoring tools. The program is a very hands on, and so we are not able to offer it as a distance course, or even to students without weekly transportation to the Ithaca campus.

The afterschool program is held twice a year, once each during the Cornell semesters. The program runs for 10 weeks, excluding Ithaca City School District holidays. The Fall session starts in October while the Spring session begins in February. The program meets once a week in the afternoon for two hours, though the exact schedule is set each semester depending on staffing availability.

For more information on current and past offerings of the afterschool program, please [contact the GDIAC director]({{ site.url }}/contact/). At this time, Cornell does not offer a summer program in game design. However, we are still evaluating this possibility, so please check again in the future.
