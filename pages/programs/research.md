While GDIAC does not directly sponsor graduate research, they are several faculty members at Cornell involved in games-related projects. Below is just a sample of the currently active reseach projects at Cornell. If you are interested in doing graduate work in these areas, please contact the relevant faculty members directly.

## [Sound Rendering](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Sound/)

Doug James's recent work has focused on real-time procedural sound generation for games. This work has been featured by the BBC and NPR.

## [Scalable Games](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/bigreddata/games/)

The Cornell Database group has been actively researching ways to use database technology and cloud computing to improve both player and NPC scalability in games and simulations.

## [Global Illumination](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kb/)

While Kavita Bala's research on scalable illumination is not limited to games, she has sponsored independent research projects for several students that have gone on to the industry.
