GameX was a in-house game engine developed at Cornell in the early years of GDIAC. It was a useful tool before the rise of other free game engines such as [XNA](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/centrum-xna.aspx), [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), or [Cocos2D](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/). However, GameX is no longer used here at Cornell.

Because we are aware that some people at still working with GameX (and several of the games in the [gallery]({{ site.url }}/gallery) are built with GameX), we are still providing access to the old GameX site. This archived site is provided as a service to the community; we will not respond to support requests for GameX.
